                <p>I am a film buff, videogame enthusiast, sci-fi-fantasy book lover. I often get asked what's considered my favorite this and that, but my answer will always be "I don't know" because I experience a diverse range of entertainment. I tend to lean towards the sci-fi and fantasy genre. I love the designs that go into interpreting the cyberpunk genre such as the concept art and 3D models of Blade Runner 2049, Deus Ex series, and Cyberpunk. </p>
                
                <p>The reason I am in this bookcamp is because of the potential job opportunity it offers. Although that may be the main reason, I am inspired by the promotional websites that are done for films and videogames. </p>
                
                <p>In the mock portfolio section, I've listed some websites that I hope to be able to make. I also aim to start learning how to draw and do graphic design if I'm not too lazy as I am also fascinated by front-end development and UX designing.</p>
